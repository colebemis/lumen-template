# Add a tag

Add a tag to a note with the `#` symbol followed by the tag name. If the tag doesn't exist, Lumen will create it automatically. A note can have as many tags as you want.

You can create a tag hierarchy using a `/` to separate the tag names. For example, `#tag1/tag2` will create a `tag1` tag with a `tag2` subtag. Both `tag1` and `tag2` will be added to the note.
